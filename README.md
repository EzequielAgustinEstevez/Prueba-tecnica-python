# shooju-test
Python task for Shooju

<h2>Background</h2>

- General info on the data is here https://www.jodidata.org/gas/database/data-downloads-beta.aspx and a detailed description of the dataset here https://www.jodidata.org/_resources/files/downloads/manuals/jodi-gas-manual.pdf
- General time series info is here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series

<h2>Task</h2>
The goal is to create a single python2/3 file that uses only standard libraries that:<br>

1. Uses only the URL https://www.jodidata.org/_resources/files/downloads/gas-data/jodi_gas_csv_beta.zip as input
2. Downloads, unzips, parses based on that single URL input
3. Writes to stdout a new line delimited (\n) JSON series-by-series representation of the input CSV

Each JSON series representation should be an object with 3 keys:

- series_id: some unique series id; it should be meaningful to the series it is identifying
- points: an array of date(time)/float arrays; the date(time) should be in ISO format as defined at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
- fields: an object of any additional metadata available at the source that helps to describe and identify the data; a series representing Brazilian GDP might have two main keys: "country" and "concept" as in the example below

Below is an example of a single JSON series (with new lines only for readability; this data is not related to the data from the task above -- it just shows structure):

```
{
    "series_id":"my-data\\brazil\\GDP",
    "points":[
      ["2016-01-01", 12.3],
      ["2017-01-01", 12.7],
      ["2018-01-01", 13.1]
    ],
    "fields":{
      "country":"Brazil",
      "concept":"Gross Domestic Product",
      "units":"USD, Millions",
      "source":"IMF"
    }
}
```
The python script should output one series per line, and each line should be valid JSON (like above).
